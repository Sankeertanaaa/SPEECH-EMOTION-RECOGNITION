## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose of the Project
The Speech Emotion Recognition System is designed to analyze speech patterns and detect emotions using advanced machine learning techniques. The primary purpose is to assist medical professionals in understanding and monitoring patients' emotional states through speech analysis. The system provides detailed reports with emotion detection, speech metrics, and transcriptions to support better patient care and treatment decisions.

### 1.2 Proposed System
The proposed system consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - User-friendly interface for both doctors and patients
   - Audio recording and upload capabilities
   - Real-time analysis display
   - Report viewing and management

2. **Backend Server**
   - RESTful API architecture
   - Secure authentication and authorization
   - File storage and management
   - Report generation

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
   - Emotion detection using deep learning models
   - Speech-to-text transcription
   - Analysis metrics calculation

### 1.3 Scope of the Project
The project scope includes:

- Speech emotion detection for 8 basic emotions (angry, calm, disgust, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, surprised)
- Audio file processing (WAV, MP3, WebM formats)
- Real-time audio recording and analysis
- PDF report generation with detailed analysis
- User role management (doctors and patients)
- Secure data storage and access
- Historical report tracking and analysis
